# The Mathematician Pirate

## Math game for kids of 1st/2nd grade...

which I created in order to learn ThreeJS.

It is **not optimized** for cellphones, only over tablets (width >= 1024px)

The game is called **The Mathematician Pirate** and the kids need to solve some addition and subtraction question.

The child must click on each square adjacent to the characters' position, in order to move the character.
As soon as the character reachs the square where the result of his calculation is located, double-click (or long press for tablet users) to dig and find the hidden coin.

Beside the french URL: [https://le-pirate-mathematicien.herokuapp.com/](https://le-pirate-mathematicien.herokuapp.com/), I translated the app to English and Portuguese as well.

I hope the kids enjoy it!
